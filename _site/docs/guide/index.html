<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Welcome to grammY!
You've come to the right place.</p>
<h2>What Is grammY?</h2>
<p>grammY is a framework for creating Telegram bots.
It can be used from TypeScript and JavaScript and runs on Node.js, Deno, and in the browser.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="./introduction">Introduction</a> if you're new to writing Telegram bots, especially if you have little coding experience.</p>
<p>If you know how to write an application for Node.js or Deno or have already created a Telegram bot with another bot framework, get up and running in minutes with our <a href="./getting-started">Getting Started</a> guide.</p>
<h2>About the Documentation</h2>
<p>The documentation for grammY bots is divided into three layers.</p>
<ol>
<li>High-level grammY docs <em>(this website)</em></li>
<li><a href="https://deno.land/x/grammy/mod.ts">Low-level grammY API reference</a></li>
<li><a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api">Raw HTTP API reference by Telegram</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The first part</strong> (you're looking at it!) explains how bots work and how to use grammY.
This is what you will use most often.
The <em>Learn</em> section is always a good start.
Also check out our great collection of <em>Plugins</em>, and have a look at the <em>Examples</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The second part</strong> is the <a href="https://deno.land/x/grammy/mod.ts">grammY API reference</a>, linked at the top of the page.
This is a detailed overview of every single bit of code that grammY provides.
It is automatically generated from grammY's code and contains all of the useful tooltip explanations, normally found by hovering your cursor over any element of grammY in a code editor.</p>
<p><strong>The third part</strong> is provided by Telegram and lists the raw definitions of the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api">HTTP API</a> that grammY will connect to under the hood.
The grammY API reference links to it wherever that makes sense.
Have a look at it when you are interested in the detailed options that you can pass to API calls.</p>
